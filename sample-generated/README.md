# Sample Generated Test Artifacts

This directory contains examples of files that would be generated by the test generator script. These samples demonstrate what the output would look like when processing this user story:

```
As a shopper, I want to filter products by price low to high so that I can find the most affordable items first
```

## Files in this Directory

- `product-filtering.feature`: Example Gherkin feature file with scenarios for product sorting
- `product-filtering-steps.js`: Custom step definitions to support the feature file
- `SauceDemoProductsPage-enhanced.js`: Enhanced page object with methods for product sorting
- `generator-output.txt`: Sample terminal output when running the generator
- `command-examples.md`: Various command examples for running the generator
- `generator-workflow.md`: A typical workflow when using the generator

## How to Use the Generator

To use the actual test generator (not these samples):

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install openai dotenv
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the generator:
   ```bash
   npm run generate -- --story "Your user story here"
   ```

## Learning from the Examples

These examples demonstrate:

1. **Feature File Structure**: Well-organized scenarios with appropriate tags and steps
2. **Custom Step Definitions**: Implementation of steps that aren't covered by common steps
3. **Enhanced Page Objects**: Adding methods to support new functionality
4. **Command Usage**: Different ways to run the generator
5. **Workflow**: Best practices for generating and implementing tests

## Next Steps

After reviewing these examples:

1. Try creating your own user stories
2. Run the generator with your stories
3. Review and refine the generated tests
4. Execute the tests against the actual application

Remember to always review and potentially customize the generated files before using them in your test suite.
